**I don't read enough scientific papers.** So, inspired and slightly awed by this recent Tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My PhD supervisor always said ‚a paper a day‘. And ever since it’s always been my first item on the task list. <a href="https://t.co/eow9Yo2MTa">https://t.co/eow9Yo2MTa</a></p>&mdash; Mark James Hopwood (@Markinthelab) <a href="https://twitter.com/Markinthelab/status/1119300840513253378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I've decided to try to start reading one paper each working day. I have decided to adjust the rules slightly: attending a seminar is allowed instead of reading a paper. Either option achieves my main aim, which is to be exposed to more ideas, and to keep up with other people's research. Given my field of research, the content will mostly be related in some way to marine biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle, but I'll be trying to explore a diversity of themes rather than just sticking in my comfort zone.

I'll also try to briefly summarise what I've read each week in a blog post, of which this is the first. This is mostly for my own benefit (for future reference, and to pressure myself into continuing), but hopefully you may find it useful too!

## Seminar: *Listening to the Voice of the Earth*

Ralph Keeling of Scripps Institution of Oceanography delivered the Zuckermann Lecture at the University of East Anglia.


## Intraseasonal dynamics of the mixed layer pump
