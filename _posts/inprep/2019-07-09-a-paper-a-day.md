**I don't read enough scientific papers.** So, inspired and slightly awed by this Tweet, I've decided to try to start reading one paper each working day:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My PhD supervisor always said ‚a paper a day‘. And ever since it’s always been my first item on the task list. <a href="https://t.co/eow9Yo2MTa">https://t.co/eow9Yo2MTa</a></p>&mdash; Mark James Hopwood (@Markinthelab) <a href="https://twitter.com/Markinthelab/status/1119300840513253378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

What follows is an account of my first 2 months of attempting to stick to this resolution.

## What's a "paper" anyway?

For me, the main purpose of this exercise is to expand my scientific horizons: to expose myself to new ideas, and to keep up with the torrent of newly published literature better.

Attending a seminar should achieve these aims just as well as reading a paper (better than, if it's a good seminar that doesn't just describe a single study). The same applies for being at a conference. I therefore decided right at the start that days with seminars or conferences counted too.

I did not allow trading between days - so no making up for missing days with extras elsewhere. Otherwise with an exchange rate of 1 paper per talk you could skive off from reading for *weeks* after a conference!

I did not read at weekends or during annual leave.

## Even so I have failed to "read a paper" a day

More often through forgetfulness than anything else.

## "I do not have time"

Quite a few people have said this to me when I've explained what I'm doing. My response is to change what you mean by "reading" a paper.

## Find a nice spot

{no distractions - use a print-out - with apologies to the trees}

{generally after lunch - unproductive}

## Choose what to read

{journal alert dump}

## Reflect and record

{write some bullets}

{keep track of what you've read for easy reference}
