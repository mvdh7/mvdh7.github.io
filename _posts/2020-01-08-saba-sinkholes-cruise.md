During the first half of December 2019 I joined a group of scientists from NIOZ and Wageningen University & Research (WUR) on the research ship *Pelagia*. Last year, some previously unknown sinkholes were discovered in the Luymes Bank, part of the Saba Bank carbonate platform, which lies to the southwest of the Dutch island of the Saba in the Caribbean. During that earlier cruise, there was only time to tow a camera through a couple of the sinkholes. In one, the researchers discovered remarkable fields of calcareous algae pillars, like a terracotta army marching across the seafloor. These structures were unlike anything ever seen before.
