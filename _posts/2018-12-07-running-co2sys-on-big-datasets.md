# Running CO<sub>2</sub>SYS on big datasets

## What is CO<sub>2</sub>SYS?

Carbon dioxide dissolves in seawater and undergoes a variety of chemical reactions, collectively known as the *marine carbonate system* (MCS). If we measure any two properties of the MCS, we can calculate all of the others. This calculation is called *solving the MCS*. In MATLAB, the function [CO<sub>2</sub>SYS](https://github.com/jamesorr/CO2SYS-MATLAB) can be used to solve the MCS.
