# Calkulate

**Calkulate lifts the veil of mystery shrouding how total alkalinity is determined from a titration.**

Calkulate is a Python toolbox to determine total alkalinity from potentiometric titration data using a selection of methods including least-squares fitting and using Gran plots. Calkulate can also determine the acid titrant molarity given certified reference material measurements.

Calkulate v2.0 is in beta. The original v1.0 was written for MATLAB and only implements a half-Gran-plot method, but it is [still available on GitHub](https://github.com/mvdh7/calkulate/tree/1.0.2). A paper is in preparation describing v2.0, but for now the best citation to use is:
