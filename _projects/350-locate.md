# Riverine carbon and alkalinity flows

Rivers are an important source of dissolved carbon, nutrients and other ions to the ocean. The river water picks up some of these components through the process of weathering - dissolving minerals out of rocks on the land. Different minerals impart different chemical properties to the water. From a CO<sub>2</sub> perspective, dissolving calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) increases the water's alkalinity, which enhances its capacity to take up CO<sub>2</sub> from the air. Rivers with catchments through limestone bedrock therefore provide significant fluxes of alkalinity to the surrounding ocean, stabilising additional dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> in the seawater, and elevating its pH.

<h2>UK river chemistry monitoring</h2>
<p><a href="http://locate.ac.uk/">LOCATE</a> is a multidisciplinary project undertaking the first ever coordinated chemical sampling of Great Britain's major rivers. Many of these rivers, especially towards the south, include limestone in their catchments, making them of particular interest for understanding the marine carbonate system in the surrounding northwest European shelf sea.</p>

<p>PhD student <a href="https://people.uea.ac.uk/ruth_s_payne">Ruth Payne</a> is measuring the dissolved CO<sub>2</sub> and alkalinity in LOCATE samples at the University of East Anglia (UEA). I am supervising Ruth's PhD studies along with lead supervisor <a href="https://people.uea.ac.uk/d_bakker">Dr Dorothee Bakker</a> (also at UEA), <a href="https://people.uea.ac.uk/n_greenwood">Dr Naomi Greenwood</a> and <a href="https://www.cefas.co.uk/about-us/people/dr-silke-kroeger/">Dr Silke Kr√∂ger</a> (Cefas), and <a href="https://noc.ac.uk/people/rics">Prof Richard Sanders</a> (NOC Southampton). The results will allow us to better quantify the flows of alkalinity and dissolved inorganic carbon from rivers into the shelf sea from the whole island of Great Britain, and study their consequences for oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake from the atmosphere and ocean acidification.</p>

<p>Measuring the LOCATE samples has required pushing the analytical instruments at UEA beyond their normal bounds. These instruments (i.e. VINDTAs) were primarily designed for measuring salty seawater samples from the open ocean, not fresh and brackish river and estuary water. Ruth has been modifying the UEA VINDTAs' hardware and software to more reliably determine the LOCATE samples' alkalinity over a wider range of salinity. We are also further developing my <a href="../calkulate">Calkulate</a> software to ensure that meaningful alkalinity values can be extracted from these unusual titration data.</p>
