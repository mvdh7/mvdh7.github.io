# **GEOTRACES**

## South Atlantic carbonate chemistry

I have produced the carbonate chemistry datasets for two GEOTRACES cruises. In 2012, I sailed across the South Atlantic Ocean from South Africa to Uruguay on RRS *James Cook* for a UK occupation of the GA10 transect at 40Â°S, collecting and analysing seawater samples for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) at sea. My Masters student Charlotte Miskin-Hymas later measured DIC and TA for samples collected by R/V *Meteor* on a 2016 German occupation of transect GA08, in the Benguela upwelling region off the southeast coast of Africa.
