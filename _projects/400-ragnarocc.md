# **RAGNARoCC and the EEL**

The North Atlantic has the greatest inventory of anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> of any of the world's oceans. I investigated this phenomenon during my PhD at the University of Southampton, using marine carbonate system data from the Extended Ellett Line (EEL) transect between Scotland and Iceland measured by a series of my Masters students. This work continued at a postdoc level through the RAGNARoCC (Radiatively Active Gases from the North Atlantic Region and Climate Change) research programme.
