# **UK Ocean Acidification**

The UK Ocean Acidification research programme ([UKOA](https://www.oceanacidification.org.uk)) sent three research cruises to monitor the progress and identify the effects of the pH decline known as ocean acidification that accompanies oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. I participated in the final two expeditions, to the Arctic and Southern Oceans, as part of the carbonate chemistry team.

## High-latitude carbonate chemistry

Tynan et al.

## Polar plankton

Richier et al., Daniels et al., Poulton et al.
