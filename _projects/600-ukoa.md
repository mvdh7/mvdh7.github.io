# UK Ocean Acidification

The [UK Ocean Acidification programme (UKOA)](https://www.oceanacidification.org.uk) deployed the RRS *James Clark Ross* to investigate the progression and impacts of the pH decline called ocean acidification that accompanies oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. The first cruise circumnavigated the UK, while the others explored the Atlantic sectors of the Arctic and Southern Oceans. I joined the carbonate chemistry team at sea for the two polar expeditions.

## High-latitude carbonate chemistry

One UKOA task was to monitor the

## Charismatic megafauna

We had a remarkable encounter with a family of polar bears in the sea ice off Greenland:
