# **UK Ocean Acidification**

The UK Ocean Acidification research programme ([UKOA](https://www.oceanacidification.org.uk)) sent three research cruises to monitor the progress and identify the effects of the pH decline known as ocean acidification that accompanies oceanic CO<sub>2</sub> uptake. I participated in the final two expeditions, to the Arctic and Southern Oceans on the RRS *James Clark Ross*, as part of the carbonate chemistry team.
