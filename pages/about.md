# **About me**

**The dominant theme of my research is to understand how the ocean responds to ongoing anthropogenic emission of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).** I study the processes that drive anthropogenic CO<sub>2</sub> to dissolve into seawater, scrutinise the consequent progress of ocean acidification, and unravel the interactions between the changing carbon cycle and other marine biogeochemical systems.
