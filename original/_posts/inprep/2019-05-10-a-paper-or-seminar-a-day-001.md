**I don't read enough scientific papers.** So, inspired and slightly awed by the Tweet below, I've decided to try to start reading one paper each working day.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My PhD supervisor always said ‚a paper a day‘. And ever since it’s always been my first item on the task list. <a href="https://t.co/eow9Yo2MTa">https://t.co/eow9Yo2MTa</a></p>&mdash; Mark James Hopwood (@Markinthelab) <a href="https://twitter.com/Markinthelab/status/1119300840513253378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 19, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I have decided to adjust the rules slightly: attending a seminar is allowed instead of reading a paper. Either option achieves my main aim, which is to be exposed to more ideas, and to keep up with other people's research. Given my field of research, the content will mostly be related in some way to marine biogeochemistry and the carbon cycle, but I'll be trying to explore a diversity of themes rather than just sticking in my comfort zone.

Some weeks, I'll also try to briefly summarise what I've read in a blog post, of which this will be the first. This is mostly for my own benefit (for future reference; as speed-writing practice; and to pressure myself into continuing), but hopefully you may find it useful too!

## The structure of water in seawater

> Brewer, P. G., Peltzer, E. T., and Walz, P. M. (2019). **How Much H<sub>2</sub>O Is There in the Ocean? The Structure of Water in Sea Water.** *Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans* 124, 212–226. [doi:10.1029/2018JC014457](https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JC014457).

The conceptual framework used to study seawater chemistry is often quite disconnected from the equivalent 'pure' chemistry approach, mostly because of how complex the mixture of solutes in seawater is. From previous papers and presentations I've found that Peter Brewer often manages to bridge the divide between these fields, using results that are well-known to 'proper' chemists to reveal new insights into the seawater system. This paper is one such study.

Brewer et al. use Raman spectroscopy data to show that the water in seawater exists in three categories:

  1. As 'free' H<sub>2</sub>O;
  2. In hydrogen-bonded clusters i.e. (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><i>n</i></sub>;
  3. In ion solvation shells.

There are a whole spectrum of hydrogen-bonded forms with different <i>n</i>, but the main one is a tetrahedral pentamer (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub> (five H<sub>2</sub>O arranged in a pyramid). Typically, about 78-85% of the water is in a hydrogen-bonded cluster, while at most 20% is free H<sub>2</sub>O. These two forms exist in equilibrium with each other; the equilibrium state is mainly controlled by temperature, with more (H<sub>2</sub>O)<sub>5</sub> in colder water. Brewer et al. show that the varying proportions of water between these forms, and their relative susceptibility to pressure, can help to explain the effect of temperature on properties like the speed of sound.

At a salinity of 35, about 6% of the water is locked up in an ion solvation shell. Intuitively, this percentage is dictated by the salinity, with which it has a linear relationship. This component does not appear to be influential in setting the bulk water properties.

## Seminar: *Listening to the Voice of the Earth*

Ralph Keeling of Scripps Institution of Oceanography delivered the Zuckermann Lecture at the University of East Anglia, titled *Listening to the Voice of the Earth, as conveyed through the changes in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2</sub>*.

## Intraseasonal dynamics of the mixed layer pump
